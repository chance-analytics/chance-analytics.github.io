  <h2 id="about">About</h2>
  <p>
    I am a data and AI analyst and a CPA license holder, passionate about using data science and AI to turn business and finance questions into clear, actionable insights. I have a strong quantitative background with a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Economics &amp; Management, plus dual master’s degrees in Data Science and Accountancy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Across my career, I have worked on financial analysis and audit, machine learning pipelines for real business problems, business intelligence engineering and analytics, stakeholder presentations, and cloud data migration reconciliation pipelines. I focus on practical outcomes—making the results easy to understand, easy to trust, and useful for decision-making.
  </p>
  <p>
    My hands-on toolkit includes Python, R, SQL, AWS, Snowflake, Tableau, Jira, and Bitbucket—along with whatever tools are needed to deliver efficiently and reliably.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I am putting more focus on integrating large language models into my workflows through approaches like RAG and fine-tuning, and exploring how AI agents can improve work and life efficiency while maintaining strong security and privacy practices.

      California Wildfire Containment & Housing Exposure Modeling
    </a></h3>
    <p>
      I built an end-to-end analysis in a Jupyter Notebook to explore California wildfire records and estimate two outcomes:
      wildfire containment duration and potential housing value exposure by linking wildfire patterns with Zillow home value data.
      The work included data cleaning and EDA, then a baseline Linear Regression model and a stronger Random Forest Regressor,
      evaluated with regression metrics (RMSE / R²).
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, pandas, matplotlib/seaborn, scikit-learn (feature preprocessing, SelectKBest mutual information, PCA, LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor).</p>

      Candlestick Chart Image Classification for Short-Term Price Movement (Computer Vision + Multi-Modal Fusion)
    </a></h3>
    <p>
      This project asked whether a model could “read” candlestick chart images and predict short-term price movement.
      I built a reproducible pipeline using daily OHLCV data for SPY, AAPL, MSFT, and NVDA (2015–2025), created 3-class labels with
      a triple-barrier method (Up/Down/Hold using a 20-day horizon and ±5% barriers), and generated standardized candlestick PNG images
      (224×224) from rolling lookback windows. I trained a vision-only ResNet18 baseline and tested two multi-modal fusion variants that
      combined images with numeric indicators (MACD, RSI, Bollinger) using time-based splits. Results were modest (~0.45 test accuracy and
      macro-F1), with persistent confusion between Up and Down.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, PyTorch, ResNet18, time-based validation, technical indicators (MACD/RSI/Bollinger).</p>

      Childcare Affordability & Pricing Disparities Dashboard (Tableau + Data Storytelling)
    </a></h3>
    <p>
      This project analyzed U.S. childcare pricing and affordability (2008–2022), comparing center-based vs. family-based care and showing
      how costs varied by region/state, household income, and gender-related burden. I built a Tableau data story with supporting analysis
      in Python/Jupyter, focusing on metrics like cost-to-income ratios and regional disparities, then summarized findings and recommendations
      in a presentation deck.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Tableau, Python/Jupyter, data cleaning, dashboard storytelling.</p>

      CLI Weather App (OpenWeatherMap API)
    </a></h3>
    <p>
      A Python command-line app where users enter a ZIP code or city/state, and the tool retrieves and displays current weather conditions
      (temperature, feels-like, highs/lows, pressure, humidity, description) in Celsius/Fahrenheit/Kelvin. Built with REST API calls to
      OpenWeatherMap (Geocoding + Current Weather), regex-based validation, JSON parsing, and error handling.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, requests, REST APIs, regex validation, JSON parsing.</p>

      EV vs. Gas Cars: Lifecycle Environmental Impact Analysis
    </a></h3>
    <p>
      A research-based project comparing electric vs. gasoline vehicles across full lifecycle impacts (materials/production, manufacturing,
      operation, and end-of-life). I used structured web research and Google Trends to contextualize public interest, then summarized the
      key tradeoffs and caveats in a written report and PowerPoint presentation.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Research synthesis, Google Trends, report writing and presentation.</p>

      GenAI Stock Stance Dashboard (Fine-Tuning + Technical Indicators + Streamlit App)
    </a></h3>
    <p>
      An end-to-end GenAI-assisted stock analysis system that scored a personal watchlist (~129 tickers) using engineered technical indicators
      plus a fine-tuned OpenAI “stance head” model. A Python pipeline pulled ~420 trading days of OHLCV data, computed indicators (RSI, MACD,
      Bollinger Bands, 52-week range, support/resistance, TD Sequential), generated a transparent rule-based local score, then called the
      fine-tuned model to produce an LLM stance, score, and summary. Finally, it blended local and LLM scores into a final decision surfaced
      in an interactive Streamlit dashboard with filtering, sorting, charts, and per-ticker drilldowns.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, yfinance, feature engineering, fine-tuned LLM, Streamlit dashboard.</p>

      Investment Strategy Research & Market Predictability (R + EDA)
    </a></h3>
    <p>
      This project explored whether common investment approaches (technical indicators, fundamental analysis, algorithmic trading) showed
      evidence of superior return potential and what conditions mattered. Using R, I pulled market/economic and fund-location datasets and
      applied cleaning, transformations, summary statistics, correlation analysis, Shapiro–Wilk normality tests, and visualization
      (moving averages, RSI, rolling volatility, histograms, and scatter/pairs plots) to evaluate relationships and feasibility of predictive modeling.

    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> R, quantmod, TTR, ggplot2, GGally, statistical testing.</p>

      Night vs. Day Crash Severity Analysis (ThinkStats2 / Python EDA + Hypothesis Testing)
    </a></h3>
    <p>
      Using a Miami, FL crash dataset (2016–2023; ~186k records), this project tested whether crashes were more severe at night than during the day
      (defined using astronomical twilight). I performed data cleaning/outlier handling, EDA (histograms, PMF/CDF, correlations), and hypothesis
      testing (chi-square and one-sided mean-difference tests) in Python using ThinkStats2/thinkplot and statsmodels.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, pandas/NumPy, ThinkStats2, statsmodels, hypothesis testing.</p>

      Prediction Markets for Next-Day S&P 500 Forecasting (Polymarket + Feature Engineering + Walk-Forward ML)
    </a></h3>
    <p>
      This project tested whether Polymarket probabilities could be turned into useful signals for forecasting whether SPY went up or down the next trading day.
      I pulled market metadata (Gamma API), downloaded YES-token price histories (CLOB prices-history), converted them into daily probability features, and aligned
      them to U.S. trading days alongside SPY and VIX. Because “SPX up/down tomorrow” markets were sparse, I pivoted to a broader set of finance/econ markets and
      aggregated them into topic signals (e.g., crypto, rates) to reduce missingness. Using walk-forward validation and elastic-net logistic regression, I found
      limited accuracy lift but a meaningful AUC improvement after adding VIX, suggesting better ranking across regimes.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, API ingestion, feature engineering, walk-forward validation, elastic-net logistic regression.</p>

      Stock Market Prediction Pipeline & Modeling (Python + SQL + Web Scraping + ETL + ML/NLP)
    </a></h3>
    <p>
      An end-to-end stock market prediction pipeline focused on a daily up/down classifier for SPY. I automated ETL across three sources:
      FRED macro indicators, Yahoo Finance market data, and Wikipedia world events (web scraping/text). I standardized and aligned fields to a
      daily timeline, engineered features (EMA/RSI/MACD/Bollinger + macro variables + event-sentiment signals), stored the final dataset in SQLite,
      then trained and tuned Random Forest and XGBoost models with time-based splits (2020–2023 train, 2024 test). Performance was modest (~50–53%)
      out-of-sample, highlighting the difficulty of short-horizon market prediction.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, pandas, SQLite, web scraping, ETL, Random Forest, XGBoost, GridSearchCV.</p>
